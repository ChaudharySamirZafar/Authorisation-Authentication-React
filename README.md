## React Template - Authentication and authorisation

#### Example:

##### Breakdown of the application
- User registers and created a account
- User logs in and receives a access token
- User is granted access to certain pages only if they have a valid access token
- This Application uses an API Template that I have created in Spring boot, you can access that here : https://github.com/ChaudharySamirZafar/Authentication-AuthorisationAPI

## Reflection
  - What was the context for this project?
    - This application was built as I wanted to set up a template application in React that included Authorisation and Authentication, making it easy for others to quickly start a project that has these two requirements.
  - What did you set out to build?
    - An application that allowed users to register, login and dynamically updated the navigation.
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
    - This project required me to learn some next concepts. It helped me understand the concept of access tokens, jwt, react-router and how to protect pages.
  - What tools did I use to implement this project?
      - ReactJS
      - Before I had my local api set up, I used firebase.
